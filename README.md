# Bamazon

For this assignment, I have created a program where a customer can log into "Bamazon" and purchase items that are listed in my Mysql table.

When prompted the customer can put a "Q" to quit the program or insurt the name of the product they would like to purchase.  After selecting a product, the customer will be prompted with the quantity they would like to purchase.
